# Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has critically impacted the world's population, especially the health and well-being of older adults [1-2]. In response, socially assistive robots emerged as pivotal tools, aiding healthcare facilities in health monitoring, visitor screening, cognitive training, and physical training [1] Robots can support healthcare professionals in daily care routines [3] and offer companionship. Subsequently, conceiving a robot with canine attributes can deepen the relational dynamics between humans and robots [4]. Therefore, a   multipurpose payload for Boston Dynamics Spot is proposed, envisioning a future where a robotic dog plays a central role in notable tasks such as caregiving, fall monitoring, and providing companionship.
